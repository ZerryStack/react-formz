# Field

A `Field` is responsible for consuming a slice of data from its' parent form's state. A `Field` essentially _owns_ that slice of data
although other `Field`'s can subscribe and mutate that data if needed. The goal of the `Field` component is to abstract away all of the complexities of dealing with form inputs including:

- Validation
- Error Management
- Focus Management
- Accessibility

## User Interface

By default a `Field` just renders a single html `input` however for most projects you will probably want to render your own user interface. You can render your own user interface using the `as` property of a `Field`.

The example below shows a custom component being rendered. The component you pass in will recieve several props that you can use to display information related to the field:

- error - The error if there is one
- input - Props belonging to the html input
- actions - An object that contains functions that you can use to interact with a fields state

You can view the full api spec of the `field` [here](/docs/api/field).

```tsx
import { Form, TextField, NumberField, ErrorMessage } from "@zerry/react-formz";

type FormState = {
  name: string;
  age: number;
};

function MyForm() {
  function handleSubmit(data) {
    apiRequest(data);
  }

  return (
    <Form<FormState>
      initialValues={{
        name: "",
        age: "",
      }}
      name="SimpleForm"
      onSubmit={handleSubmit}
      resetOnSubmit
    >
      <TextField
        name="name"
        label="Name"
        required
        as={({ input: { label, ...input } }) => (
          <>
            <label htmlFor={input.name}>{label}</label>
            <input {...input} />
            <ErrorMessage field={input.name} />
          </>
        )}
      />
      <NumberField
        name="age"
        label="Age"
        required
        min={18}
        max={75}
        as={({ input: { label, ...input } }) => (
          <>
            <label htmlFor={input.name}>{label}</label>
            <input {...input} />
            <ErrorMessage field={input.name} />
          </>
        )}
      />
    </Form>
  );
}
```

## Helper Components

A first principle of React Formz is to be declarative, that's the whole point of using React in the first place, right?
Forms are no different, as a result we export a number of wrapper components like `NumberField` that come with defaults
and type safety to make your forms easy to ready and type-safe.

### TextField

An abstraction of `Field` that can be used for text field values. The default input type will be `text` but can be overriden.

The `value` of this field can only be a string.

### NumberField

An abstraction of `Field` that can be used for number field values. The default input type will be `number`.

The `value` of this field can only be a number.

### CheckboxField

An abstraction of `Field` that can be used for boolean field values. The default input type will be `checkbox`.

The `value` of this field can only be a boolean.

### RadioField

An abstraction of `Field` that can be used for radio field values. The default input type will be `radio`.

The `value` of this field can only be a string.

### SelectField

An abstraction of `Field` that can be used for boolean field values. The default input type will be `select`.

The `value` of this field can only be a boolean.

### MultiSelectField

An abstraction of `Field` that can be used for boolean field values. The default input type will be `select` with a `multiple` property
added to the input.

The `value` of this field can only be a string.

### CustomField

A custom field is a `Field` where the value is not your typical html input value like your usual string, number, date, etc.

This field is great for integrating with third party libraries who's api's are not standard html input such as `react-select`.

**Example Usage**:

```tsx
// The value of this custom field is a tuple of dates: [Date, Date].
<CustomField<[Date, Date]>
  as={({ input: { value, ...input } }) => (
    <ReactDatePicker {...input} startDate={value[0]} endDate={value[1]} />
  )}
/>
```
