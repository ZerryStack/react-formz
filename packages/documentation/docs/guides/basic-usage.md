# Basic Usage

The goal of React Formz is to make form building feel natural, painless and declarative so the api is designed to be easy-to-use and solve common issues with building forms behind the scenes.

The most basic components of React Formz are `Form` and `Field`. `Form`'s serve as the contextual data and api wrapper for all of its' fields. Fields can be nested to any depth, dynamically rendered and deleted as needed.
