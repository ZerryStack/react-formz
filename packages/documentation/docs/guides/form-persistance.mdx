# Form Persistance

One frustrating aspect of forms for users is when you are filling out a form and either your session expires, you accidentally close the browser
or something else happens to your workflow and all of the data you have been entering is suddenly lost. React Formz has built-in localStorage persistance
that will save a forms state locally and should something interupt a users ability to finish the form their values will be restored.
