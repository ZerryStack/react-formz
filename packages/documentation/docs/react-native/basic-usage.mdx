# Basic Usage

React Formz can be used in React Native as well and the API is mostly the same so the skills from using either web or native can be transferred to the alternate.
You get all of the same features with both library versions as well.

## Installation

### NPM

React Formz can be installed the same as every other package.

```sh
npm install @zerry/react-formz-native immer
```

### Yarn

```sh
yarn add @zerry/react-formz-native immer
```
